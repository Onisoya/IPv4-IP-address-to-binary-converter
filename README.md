# WHAT DOES THIS CODE DO?

My IPv4-IP-address to binary converter takes any IPv4 IP address from user and converts it to the binary equivalent. The purpose of this project, is to demonstrate my understanding of Python programming concepts relating to cybersecurity. And also, to help networking and cybersecurity students who may encounter mathematics, networking or cybersecurity projects where they need to convert IPv4 IP address to binary or convert a number(in base 10) to binary.

## FUTURE UPDATES(MOD) TO EXPECT!

This converter show be about to tell

1. If the IP address given to it is a public or private IP address
2. Whose name the IP address is registered under(if available)
3. Physical address associated to the IP address(if available)
4. More to come!!
